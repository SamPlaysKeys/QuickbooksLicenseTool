# QuickbooksLicenseTool
This is a Powershell-based tool to export Quickbooks License and Product ID information into easily readable formats from the commandline.

It is still a work in progress, and there are some known issues. This is my first project polling xml files from powershell, so help is always welcome.

To run the tool, simply execute it from the Windows Terminal by calling <code> powershell.exe .\qblicense.ps1 </code>

The Quickbooks License / Registration file is stored in the same place for all versions from Quickbooks 2019 - Current. This tool will not see licenses from before any Quickbooks 2019 versions.

Thanks, and let me know if you have any issues or questions!
